Microscope provides a structural view, keeps complexity under control and bridges the information gaps between business, analysts and technical teams. It provides dedicated views for both *Delivery Intelligence* and *Business Intelligence*.

The key however lies in the third attribute in the picture above, Microscope's **Unified Process**. There are 2 challenges that in many large orgs are disconnected:

* A Process Challenge: People do not understand the details of the structure of the org sufficiently to do their jobs.
* A Technology Challenge: No overall structural view of the org makes change very hard to manage and the Process Challenge above impossible to rectify.

Microscope addresses these together with 2 simple principles:

* Microscope provides a structure whereby *The Design*, which is the starting point of the change process, stipulates at a structural level how any new change should be built.

* Microscope provides a *Build* structure that follows the design mandate and also provides tools so that this structure is visible to everyone involved in delivery. This is used to inform future design.

Combined, these processes form a Virtuous Circle between process, design and build that we will detail in the next pages.
