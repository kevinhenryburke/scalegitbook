## Analytics App - Jobs to run

In the org, open Analytics Studio, go to Data Manager -> Connect and "Run Data Sync / Run Full Sync" for each of the Salesforce objects that are listed. Check the Monitor option to see when these have successfully run.

Next go to "Dataflows & Recipes" and select "Run Now" on the "Services Framework Dataflow" and again check the Monitor screen to see when this has run successfully. You may of course choose to schedule this to run periodically in your scratch instance too.

Finally check the "Services Performance", "Services Forensics" and "Service Connections" dashboards which should now be populated with data.
