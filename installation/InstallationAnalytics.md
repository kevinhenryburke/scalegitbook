Before installing the Microsope Analytics Package we need to add some permissions to the *CRM Analytics* *Integration User*. The data integration jobs for *CRM Analytics* cannot be deployed unless the permissions for the accessed Salesforce Objects and Fields are already in place. 

We achieve this by assigning the *Microscope Analytics Integration* permission set (API Name: *microscopeAnalyticsIntegration*) to the *Integration User*.

Once this is done we can install the package:
