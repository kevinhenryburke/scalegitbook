**Why is this app called Microscope?:** 

We hope, that like a real microscope, this app will show its users a clear view of the structure of what they are working with, for us a Salesforce implementation. 

The term also may also create a connection in the user's mind with Microservices architectures. This app does not provide a true microservice architecture, that's not its intention, but there is certainly an conceptual overlap.

And finally, Microscope can be read as providing small scope for changes and for artifacts that can be built using this architecture. This architecture facilitates a connections between scoped stories and build artifacts, and managing scope and maximizing the independence of scoped changes is at its core.
