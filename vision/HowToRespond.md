### How To respond?

If you do score low on the metrics above what should you do? One option
is to do nothing, the company soldiers on, agility has been lost and
there is significantly reduced ROI. Some companies probably don\'t
realize what options they may have, others may think that what they are
experiencing is what a big implementation of Salesforce has to look
like. Others may view that any attempt to improve the situation must by
necessity be a massive, costly and disruptive exercise that is beyond
their budget or appetite.

Those that do try to tackle the problem may consider some of the
following:

1.  Solve by Business Change: Align business processes across the
    company to simplify both working practices and technical challenges.
    This should be a part of any continuous improvement exercise.
    However in a very large organization it is unlikely to be completely
    achievable and for this to be the only mechanism to recover a build.

2.  Solve by Clarification. Establishing a clear MDM strategy is key.
    Sometimes it is extremely hard to identify either Systems of Record
    or Business Owners for data. Some clear documentation establishing
    both concepts for all objects that is communicated across all teams
    and made mandatory reading as part of team onboarding can go a long
    way.

3.  Solve technically: Start again in a new org - this is a hard option.
    There is a huge amount of valuable data in any org, the impact on
    data migration, change management and changes to interfaces is
    likely to be enormous. Splitting an org is an equally hard
    alternative.

4.  Solve technically: Mothball the existing org and start new
    developments in a new separate org. There are some key risks here.
    We are creating a whole load of integration work of data needs to be
    shared across the orgs. We will almost certainly need to duplicate
    interfaces to internal and external systems in the new org. And if
    we don't learn from what has happened in the first org who is to say
    we won't be doing this again in another couple of years and need org
    3? Â 

5.  Solve technically: In existing org. Re-engineer incrementally
    towards an extensible architecture.

There are great benefits for the first two and this level of business
clarity is always recommended but on their own they are not going to
solve the problem. Options 3 and 4 are both very expensive and both
require an immediate and significant budget and time investment before
any value is seen. The final option has the value of allowing for
incremental change and adoption of new techniques for new functionality
and this is the option we will consider for existing customers in this
paper.
