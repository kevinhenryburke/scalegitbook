This page outlines how to document Microscope. The documentation is hosted by [Gitbook](https://kevinhenryburke.gitbook.io/microscope/introduction/welcome), it is written in markdown and loaded to a branch in Github where it is synced to Gitbook as the source of the Microsope pages.

## Github access

The source for these apps is in a private repo on [Github](https://github.com/kevinhenryburke/scalegitbook). Repo info is below in clone command. You will need to authenticate to the repo within VS Studio to develop Microscope.

## Getting Documentation from the repo to VS Code

Create a new folder and open in VS Code. 

Open a new terminal in VS Code (via Terminal -> New Terminal) and run

```
git clone https://github.com/kevinhenryburke/scalegitbook.git  -b gitbooksync .

```

Any *Push to Origin* from VS Code will now become part of the live documentation set.
