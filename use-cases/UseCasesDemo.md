# Use Cases in the Demo App

We will explore a few use cases for Microscope in the Next Pages. Many of these have examples built in the Microsope Demo App which help to illuminate how to use these patterns yourself. Where this is a demo implementation of a Use Case we will include a line

**Demo App Example** : *Tab Name*

Also if you prefer a direct link to the demo tab we will reference these too

**Demo URL** : *your-domain*/*relative-path*

Here *your-domain* is the top level custom domain for the org into which you have installed the Microscope Demo.

Installation instructions for the Demo App can be found [here](../installation/InstallationDemo.md) with follow up instructions on loading settings for the demo [here](../installation/InstallationDemoPost.md).
